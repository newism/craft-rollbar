<h1 align="center">Rollbar plugin for Craft CMS</h1>

This plugin provides a [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) integration for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com).

## Features

* PHP Exception reporting to Rollbar
* JS Exception reporting to Rollbar (optional)

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4 or later. For Craft 3 support, please use the 3.x branch.

## Installation

### Plugin Store

To install [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), navigate to the Plugin Store section of your Craft control panel, search for `Rollbar`, and click the Install button.

### Composer

You can also add the package to your project using Composer.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require newism/craft-rollbar

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Rollbar.

## Configuration

First you'll need to setup a [Rollbar account](https://rollbar.com/).

Once you have an account and created your project, you'll be provided with an `Access Key`. We recommend adding this 
to your `.env` file. Then navigate to Settings > Plugins > Rollbar and start typing the name of your environment 
variable in the `Access Token` field, until you see your variable name in the autocomplete box.

In order to log JS exceptions, you'll also need to add your `postClientItemAccessToken` using the same method as above.

You can also configure your Rollbar gateway using a [config file](https://docs.craftcms.com/commerce/v2/gateway-config.html#gateway-configuration). 
An example file looks like:

    <?php
    return [
        // Your project's post_server_item access token, which you can find in the Rollbar.com interface.
        "accessToken" => '',

        // See: https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/browser-js
        "enableJs" => '',

        // Your project's post_client_item access token, which you can find in the Rollbar.com interface.
        'postClientItemAccessToken' => '',
        
        // If you wish Rollbar to ignore any exception types, please provide the fully qualified name here, separated by a comma
        'exceptionIgnoreList' => '',
    ];
